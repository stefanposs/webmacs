# Logs

The Logs page shows system log entries — informational messages, warnings, and errors generated by WebMACS during operation.

!!! info "Automatic entries"
    Most log entries are created automatically by the system (e.g. when an [automation rule](rules.md) triggers). You can also create log entries via the API.

## Viewing Logs

Navigate to **Logs** in the sidebar. The table shows:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Timestamp** | When the log entry was created (relative time, e.g. "2 minutes ago") |
| **Type** | :material-information: Info (blue), :material-alert: Warning (amber), :material-alert-circle: Error (red) |
| **Status** | `unread` or `read` |
| **Message** | Log content (up to 500 characters) |

The table is paginated (50 entries per page) and ordered newest first.

## Log Types

| Type | When It Appears |
|---|---|
| **Info** | Rule triggers, system events, general status updates |
| **Warning** | Degraded conditions, approaching thresholds, retries |
| **Error** | Failed webhook deliveries, hardware communication issues, unexpected errors |

---

## Log Sources

Logs are generated by various system components:

| Source | Example Message |
|---|---|
| Rule evaluation | "Rule 'High Temp Alert' triggered: Inlet Temperature = 215.3°C (> 200)" |
| Webhook delivery | "Webhook delivery to https://hooks.example.com/... failed: timeout" |
| System health | "Database connection restored" |
| OTA updates | "Firmware update v2.1.0 applied successfully" |

## Managing Logs via API

### List Logs

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/logging?page=1&page_size=50 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Create a Log Entry

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/logging \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Manual calibration completed for Sensor A",
    "logging_type": "info"
  }'
```

Valid `logging_type` values: `info`, `warning`, `error`

### Mark a Log as Read

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/v1/logging/$LOG_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status_type": "read"}'
```

## Best Practices

!!! tip "Recommendations"
    - **Review logs regularly** — especially after setting up new [automation rules](rules.md)
    - **Check error logs** after webhook failures — they may indicate endpoint misconfiguration
    - **Use log entries for compliance** — combine with rule-based `log` actions for automatic audit trails

---

## Next Steps

- [Automation Rules](rules.md) — rules generate log entries when they fire
- [Webhooks](webhooks.md) — failed deliveries appear as error logs
- [Dashboard](dashboard.md) — monitor real-time data
